THIS IS A PROJECT FOR DEVELOPERS 1ST YEAR RECRUITMENT 2020
I HAVE DEPLOYED MY WEB APP USING 000WEBHOST. 
IT IS A RESPONSIVE WEBSITE AND HENCE CAN BE ALSO  VIEWED USING MOBILE DIRECTLY.

*EDIT1 :In this website I have added separate leaderboards for each course that is whenever we are on a given course and click on a given leaderboard it will show top 5 most downloaded files of that course. It also works if the no. Of total files in a course is less than 5 then the leaderboard will show the available files in that course. I used this rather than centralized leaderboard to make the site more dynamic and giving insight of the most popular files in respective courses.


I AM ALSO ADDING MY CODE FOR THE SAME FOR YOUR REFERENCE.
